    <h2 id="configuring_connections">Configuring Connections</h2>

    <p>When starting andFHEM the first time some dummy data is used for previewing what the
        application looks like and
        what devices are supported. To use your own FHEM server open the navigation drawer and click
        into the drop down menu on the top. This selector
        always shows the name of the connection that is currently used for fetching data from a FHEM
        server.</p>

    <a href="../images/installation/connectionType.png"><img
            src="../images/installation/connectionType.png"/></a>

    <p>After clicking the selector a submenu opens. This submenu contains all configured
        connections. When clicking a
        connection name, the current connection changes to the newly selected one. When
        selecting the bottom item, which is called "Manage" or "Verwalten", you are directed to a
        view where you can
        manage your connections.</p>

    <a href="../images/installation/connectionList.png"><img
            src="../images/installation/connectionList.png"/></a>

    <p>All the configured connections are listed here. When clicking such a connection, you can edit
        all configured
        connection items like URL, username or password. You can also create a new one by clicking
        on the plus sign on the top.</p>

    <p>Changing a configuration or adding a new one always looks the same, except that you cannot
        change the connection
        type when editing a connection.</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: top"><a href="../images/installation/fhemweb.png"><img
                    src="../images/installation/fhemweb.png"/></a></td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top"><a href="../images/installation/telnet.png"><img
                    src="../images/installation/telnet.png"/></a></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Enter your credentials and click "Save" or "Speichern". When leaving the configuration view
        with the back key and
        reentering the collection list selector, you can select your newly created connection.</p>

    <h2 id="fhemweb">FHEMWEB</h2>

    <p>FHEM supports some web interfaces delivered together with the server itself. One of these web
        interfaces is
        FHEMWEB, which is configured by adding a line like <span class="code">define fhemweb FHEMWEB 8083 global</span>
        to your <i>fhem.cfg</i>. Before any data within andFHEM, make sure that you can access the
        web interface in a
        browser, either on your smartphone or on another computer. You should see a web page like
        the following:</p>

    <img src="../images/installation/fhemweb_view.png"/>

    <p>The same address you just entered is expected by andFHEM in the URL field within the FHEMWEB
        preferences.
        Trailing slashes do not matter. The username and password fields can be filled optionally.
        They are required if
        you want to authenticate yourself using basic authentication. If you do not know what this
        means, stop reading
        here and leave the fields empty. </p>

    <p>If you want to use the authentication feature you have to make sure that your fhem.cfg
        contains a line like <span
                class="code">attr fhemweb basicAuth aj38219cnake</span>. For information how to
        create the string after
        basicAuth, continue reading here. Now just enter your username and password in andFHEM.</p>

    <h2 id="telnet">Telnet</h2>

    <p>FHEM supports a very basic command line interface to query the current state of devices.
        Before selecting this
        option, make sure that you can access the interface from another computer in your local
        network.</p>

    <p>When using Windows, download Putty and start the program. Select telnet as connection option,
        enter the address
        of your FHEM server and add the specified port in your FHEM configuration. The port defaults
        to 7072. When
        clicking hitting the button to open the connection, a black window opens up. Hit two times
        enter to see the FHEM
        prompt showing up. If this works, andFHEM is also able to connect to FHEM.</p>

    <p>If not, make sure that your fhem.cfg contains a line such as the following: attr global port
        7072 global. 7072 is
        the port used for opening up the command line interface. Global specifies that computers can
        connect to the
        server without connecting from the computer running the FHEM server.</p>

    <p>When the above connection is successful you can enter the configuration data in andFHEM in
        the appropriate
        fields. The IP field should contain something like 192.168.0.1. It is the address of the
        computer running the
        FHEM server. Port is the above mentioned FHEM command line interface port, such as 7072.</p>


    <h2 id="fcm">Firebase Cloud Messaging</h2>

    <p>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), formerly Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) enables you to send
        push notifications to Android handsets. This allows to send updates and messages in
        near-realtime.</p>

    <p><b>Installation Steps:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Install the gcmsend module by either
            <ul>
                <li>Downloading the <a
                        href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klassm/andFHEM/master/fhem_modules/98_gcmsend.pm">98_gcmsend.pm</a>
                    manually and copy the file to the FHEM directory
                </li>
                <li>or issuing <pre class="code">update add https://github.com/klassm/andFHEM/blob/master/fhem_modules/controls_gcmsend.txt</pre>
                    within the FHEM console.
                    This approach will update the module automatically whenever I upload a new
                    version.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Make sure that your Perl installation meets all the dependencies. FHEM will tell you if
            it can load the module, especially when issuing
            <pre class="code">reload 98_gcmsend</pre><br/>
            The module depends on two perl modules, which have to be installed to
            <i>fhem/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.12.2/</i> (on FritzBoxes, otherwise choose your perl
            directory)

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Create a FCM project.
            <ul>
                <li>Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://console.firebase.google.com">https://console.firebase.google.com</a>
                    and create a new project. <br/>
                    <a href="../images/installation/gcm/1.png"><img
                            src="../images/installation/gcm/1.png"/></a>
                </li>
                <li>Enter the required project details. <br/>
                    <a href="../images/installation/gcm/2.png"><img
                            src="../images/installation/gcm/2.png"/></a>
                </li>
                <li>Hit the gear button and jump to project settings.<br/>
                    <a href="../images/installation/gcm/3.png"><img
                            src="../images/installation/gcm/3.png"/></a>
                </li>
                <li>Select cloud messaging. This page contains our required server key ("api key")
                    and the required "sender-id".<br/>
                    <a href="../images/installation/gcm/4.png"><img
                            src="../images/installation/gcm/4.png"/></a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Now we create a GCM device. Issue <pre class="code">define &lt;gcm_device_name&gt; gcmsend</pre>
            within your FHEM instance.
        </li>
        <li>Afterwards we need to configure the device to talk to FCM. This is why we have to issue
            another FHEM
            command: <br/>
            <pre class="code">attr &lt;gcm_device_name&gt; apiKey &lt;apiKey&gt;</pre><br/>
            whereas <span class="code">&lt;gcm_device_name&gt;</span> is the name of the device you
            created before and
            <span class="code">&lt;apikey&gt;</span> is the key you just created within the Google
            console (number 2
            within the image).
        </li>

        <li>Link andFHEM
            <ul>
                <li>Open the settings of andFHEM and look for a setting called "Cloud Messaging
                    Sender-ID". Enter the sender-id of the created FCM project.
                </li>
                <li>Refresh your xmllist and look for your GCMSend device you just created. Open the
                    detail page and
                    click the button to register your device. Internally, andFHEM will add your
                    device as regIds
                    attribute of your gcm device. <br/>
                    <a href="../images/installation/gcm/gcm_app.png"><img
                            src="../images/installation/gcm/gcm_app.png"/></a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="client_side_certificates">Client Side Certificates</h2>

    <p>You can enforce your webserver to ask for a certificate. Only if the clients has access to
        the correct
        certificate, the webserver will allow access to the resource (<a
                href="http://wiki.cacert.org/ApacheServerClientCertificateAuthentication">details</a>).
    </p>

    <p>To configure andFHEM to use those certificates, you have to copy them to your Android device.
        Afterwards, startup
        the configuration screen of your FHEMWEB connection and scroll down. You will find a
        checkbox to enable client
        side certificates.</p>

    <p>Below that checkbox, there are two selectors for the respective certificates. The client
        certificate is expected
        to be in p12 format. The server certificate relates to the CA certificate and is expected to
        be in PEM format.
        Please note that only those certificate formats are supported. All other formats will fail
        to work in
        combination with andFHEM.</p>
